    <h1> It's been a while</h1>
    <p> sorry, I took a break from this website. Had to record for Season 21. But anyways, I know it's stressful when I take a break, but imagine this; your whiny bum whining when I don't post every day! You should feel ashamed of yourself! Let me have my well-deserved breaks! Anyways, here's something to satiate you <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM8NrExOJCM> I think you all still like Early '90s video games, Right? No? Well, you're getting it anyways. </a></p>
